# SpellerCheck

SpellerCheck checks for mispelled words in a text given a dictionary.

This is a project for HarvardX [CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/), so my work is the dictionary.c file.

## Usage:

```bash
./speller [DICTIONARY] text
```

Example:
```bash
./speller large text.txt
```
